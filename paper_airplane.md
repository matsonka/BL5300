# Paper Airplane
Hello, I'm giving directions for a paper airplane.
First fold the paper in half vertically.
Unfold the paper and fold each of the two top corners to the center line.
Fold the top edges into the center line.
Fold the plane in half along the center line.
Fold down each of the two wings, matching the top edges up with the bottom edge of the body.
### Optional: If you want to ensure that your plane's wings stick together during flight you can add double sided tape inside the body of the plane to keep the wings together
